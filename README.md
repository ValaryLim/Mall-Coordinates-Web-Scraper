# Mall SVY21 Coordinates Web Scaper
<img src="cover_image.png" width="100" height="100">

This was a quick side-project done to retrieve the SVY21 coordinates of all shopping malls in Singapore as data points for a larger machine learning project to predict property valuations. A web scraper was built to scrape the list of shopping malls off a wikipedia site, and the One Map API was then used to retrieve the SVY21 coordinates using the mall names.

The .csv output file is also added in this repository for reference/ usage.
